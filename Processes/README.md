1. Problem 2.6. 
2. Problem 2.7. 

3. Write a simple test program to find out the parent process id of a process beforeand after its parent process terminates. 
Based on your test results, answer the following question: What is a process's parent process after its original parent process terminates? 

4. Write  a  simple  test  program  to  find  out  PIDs  of  ALL  ancestors  (i.e.,  parent, grandparent)  processes  of  the  current  process  or  a  given  process  specified  by  a  PID.  
A parent process's PID of a given process pid can be found in /proc/$pid/status

5. Run the program on your OWN laptop/desktop, and record the maximum number of child processes you see before your system crashes, as well as your machine's memory size. 

6. Design and run an experiment to measure the CPU time used by fork. 
(You may want to use the system call time). Also, report the CPU of the machine you run the experiment.
