Managing Free Memory with Linked List: write a first fit program to manage free memory using linked list. 
Then test your program using the following memory use pattern by printing out the linked list after each memory use or free event: 
there are in total 10 memory units, and the memory's use pattern is as follows: A (use 2 units) , B (use 3 units), C (use 4 units), D (free 3 units of B), E (use 1 unit), F (free 4 units of C), 
G (free 2 units of A) and I (use 5 units).
